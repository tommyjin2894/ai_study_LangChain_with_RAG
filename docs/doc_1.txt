No one sleep in Tokyo
All right crossing the line
No one quit the radio
Tokyo is on fire
Even if you say: I have been the world wide
I'll take you where surely you have never been
All night in the fight I'm okay, come on
Come on
Hey do you feel the night is breathable
Look at this town which is unbelievable
No other places like that in the world, world, world

No one sleep in Tokyo
All night crossing the line
No one quit the radio
Tokyo is on fire
No one sleep in Tokyo
All night crossing the line
No one quit the radio
Tokyo is on fire
Turning to the left easy chicks and red lights
And to the right crazy music everywhere
All right in the fight I'm okay, come on
Come on
Hey do you feel the night is breathable
Look at this town which is unbelievable
No other places like that in the world, world, world
